# Alertech Web
---
## Overview

Alertech is an integrated fire detection and alert system composed of a mobile app, a website, and an IoT device. It enables real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and smoke levels, and provides instant alerts to users and fire authorities in case of a fire.

## System Overview
### Mobile App (For Users and Neighbors)

- Monitor home environment (temperature, humidity, smoke) in real time.
- Receive alerts when a fire is detected nearby.
- Users without the IoT device can still receive alerts if a neighbor's device detects a fire.

### Website (For Fire Authority)

- Displays geolocation of all users with devices.
- Provides access to a user database containing contact information and addresses.
- Allows monitoring of temperature, smoke, and humidity levels in real time.
- Monitor and respond to fire alerts.

### IoT Device

- Built with ESP32, DHT22 (for temperature and humidity), and MQ-2 (for smoke detection).
- Detects temperature, humidity, and smoke levels.
- Sends alerts to both the user and fire station via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- Updates real-time data to Firebase, accessible through mobile and web apps.

## How It Works

### ESP32 Monitors the Environment

- Reads smoke levels and temperature.
- Sends data to Firebase in real-time.

### Instant Notifications to Users, Neighbors, & Fire Stations

- Mobile app receives alerts via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- Neighbors receive alerts if a nearby device detects danger.
- Web dashboard updates instantly.
